# Replyn Test Suite

End-to-end tests for the [Replyn](https://beta.replyn.dev) clinic app, written with Playwright and TypeScript.
They cover **login** (valid and invalid credentials), managing **doctors** and **treatments** in the UI
(create, edit, delete, required fields, server errors), and the matching **REST and login APIs**.

## Setup

**1. Install** (needs Node.js 20+):

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
```

**2. Configure:** copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the test account:

```text
TEST_USERNAME=your-test-account@example.com
TEST_PASSWORD=your-password
```

Everything else in `.env.example` is optional and defaults to the beta environment. `TEST_WORKSPACE`
(default `Testing`) is the workspace every test runs in: setup switches to it after logging in.
`.env` is git-ignored, so never commit it. On CI the GitHub secrets `SECRETU` and `SECRETP` provide the account.

**3. Run:**

| What                                                       | Command                                                           |

| All exclusive tests (run on their own)                     | `npm run test:exclusive`                                          |
| Settings → Organization (exclusive)                        | `npm run test:organization`                                       |
| Workspace General, Hours, SLAs, Assignment, AI (exclusive) | `npm run test:workspace`                                          |

| Contacts                                                   | `npm run test:contacts`                                           |
| One file                                                   | `npx playwright test tests/clinic/doctors/doctors.spec.ts`        |
| One test, by name                                          | `npx playwright test -g "when user deletes it"`                   |
| Headless (no browser window)                               | `npm run test:headless`                                           |
| Headed (watch the browser)                                 | `npm run test:headed`                                             |
| UI mode (pick, re-run and debug tests)                     | `npm run test:debug`                                              |
| Type-check / format                                        | `npm run typecheck` / `npm run format`                            |

Locally the browser window is visible by default. `test:headless` hides it, and accepts the same
options: `npm run test:headless -- tests/clinic/doctors`. You can also set `HEADLESS=true` in `.env`.

**Why some tests are exclusive (run on their own):** they change settings the other tests rely on.
Settings → Organization changes the whole app (switching the organization type to E-commerce hides the
Clinic menu); the workspace's General settings, Hours, SLAs, Assignment rules, AI switch and Lifecycle
stages change how every conversation, booking and contact behaves (the contacts tests read the stages).
They live in the `exclusive` project and run only through `npm run test:exclusive` (or the narrower
`test:organization`, `test:workspace`, `test:lifecycle`), or last in `npm run test:all`, one test at a
time, and every test restores the original values. In any other run they show as _skipped_, with that
reason. On CI they run after the regression suite.

**Why Settings → Wrap-Up runs one test at a time:** a workspace has a single wrap-up, so two tests
changing it at once would overwrite each other. Its tests have their own `workspace-settings` project
(one worker), which runs alongside the parallel tests in every normal run, and each test puts the
wrap-up back as it found it.

Every run starts with `tests/setup/auth.setup.ts`, which logs in once and saves the session for the other tests.

## Folder structure

| Folder                    | What's in it                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tests/auth/`             | Login: UI (`login.spec.ts`) and API (`login.api.spec.ts`).                                     |
| `tests/clinic/<feature>/` | Doctors, Treatments, Departments, Appointments, Billing: UI and API tests side by side.        |
| `tests/settings/<page>/`  | Every automated Settings page (Organization, Members, Contact Fields, Wrap-Up, API Keys, …).   |
| `tests/contacts/`         | Contacts: list, create, row actions, side panel and segments (UI), and the contacts API.       |
| `tests/inbox/<feature>/`  | Inbox → saved Views: UI and API tests side by side.                                            |
| `tests/setup/`            | Logs in once before the other tests and saves the session.                                     |
| `pages/`                  | Page objects (`auth/`, `clinic/`, `settings/`, `contacts/`, `inbox/`): _how_ to use each page. |
| `api/`                    | API clients: one small class per endpoint group, plus the field-name mapping to the UI forms.  |
| `fixtures/`               | The `test` that every spec imports, ready-made with page objects, API clients and cleanup.     |
| `config/`                 | `env.ts`: the only place that reads `.env` (URLs, credentials, limits).                        |
| `utils/`                  | Helpers: Faker test data, network recording/mocking, response timing.                          |
| `reporters/`              | Writes a screenshot and plain-text summary of every failed test to `test-results/failures/`.   |
| `scripts/`                | `test-all.mjs`: runs the suite, then the exclusive tests on their own.                         |
| `.github/`                | CI: smoke test, then the full suite, then the exclusive tests, on every push and PR.           |

File names decide how a test runs: `*.api.spec.ts` runs in the `api` project, other `*.spec.ts` files in `ui`.

**Known app issues are marked with `test.fail()`.** Such a test checks the behaviour we expect, and its
reason says what the app does instead and when it was seen. It passes while the issue is there, and fails
(on purpose) once the app is fixed: then delete the `test.fail()` line.

## Adding a test

Import `test` and `expect` from `fixtures/test` (not from `@playwright/test`), ask for the page objects and
clients you need, and describe the behaviour with `test.step()`:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '../../fixtures/test';
import { toDoctorPayload } from '../../api/DoctorsApi';
import { buildDoctor } from '../../utils/testData';

test('should show a new doctor in the doctors list', async ({ doctorsPage, doctorsApi, cleanup }) => {
  // 1. Arrange: create the data this test needs (the API is the fastest way).
  const doctor = await test.step('create a doctor', () =>
    doctorsApi.createRecord(toDoctorPayload(buildDoctor())));
  // 2. Always register cleanup, so the test leaves nothing behind even if it fails.
  cleanup.add(`doctor "${doctor.name}"`, () => doctorsApi.deleteIfExists(doctor.id));

  // 3. Act and assert.
  await test.step('open the doctors list', () => doctorsPage.openList());
  await test.step('the doctor is listed', async () => {
    await expect(doctorsPage.rowFor(doctor.name)).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

Guidelines:

- **Name tests like sentences:** `should <expected result> when <action>`.
- **Locators belong in page objects.** Prefer `getByRole` > `getByLabel` > `getByPlaceholder` > `getByText` > `getByTestId`.
  Use CSS only when nothing else works, and add a comment explaining why.
- **Never use `waitForTimeout`.** Use `expect(...)` (which retries) or wait for a specific API response
  (`waitForApiResponse` in `utils/network.ts`).
- **Every test creates its own data** with `utils/testData.ts` and cleans it up with `cleanup.add()`.
- A new page? Add a class in `pages/`, register it in `fixtures/test.ts`, and give every public method a short JSDoc.

## Viewing the report

After any run:

```bash
npm run report
```

This opens the HTML report: each test with its steps, and for failures a screenshot, a trace you can
step through, and the error. On CI, download the `smoke-report` / `regression-report` artifact from the
workflow run, unzip it, and run `npx playwright show-report <folder>`.

### Failure screenshots

Every failed test also gets a screenshot and a plain-text summary in `test-results/failures/`, named after
**where** it failed: `<feature folder>__<test name>__<project>__attempt-<n>`. For example:

```text
test-results/failures/
  clinic-doctors__should-save-every-field-when-user-creates-a-doctor__ui__attempt-1.png
  clinic-doctors__should-save-every-field-when-user-creates-a-doctor__ui__attempt-1.txt
```

The `.txt` file holds the error, the test's file and line, and the path of its trace. On CI these are inside the
`*-test-results` artifact. Passing `--reporter=...` on the command line replaces the configured reporters, so
leave it out if you want these files.
